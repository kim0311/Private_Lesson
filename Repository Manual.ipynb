    "## General strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to work all together on this repository.<br/> \n",
    "The general strategy to achieve this is to have a main master branch where labs<br/>\n",
    "and exercises will be posted periodically by the teaching staff\n",
    "while the students can work on their own branches.<br/>\n",
    "The teaching staff will visit the studentsâ€™ branch and provide feedback on their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to setup your branch\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Clone the repository on your local machine\n",
    "  2. Create a local branch and give it your name.\n",
    "     For example, if your name is 'paolo' do \n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "      git branch paolo\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     \n",
    "  3. Switch to your local branch \n",
    "    \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "      git checkout paolo\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  If you are using Windows you will see the name of your branch next to the directory of the repository<br> \n",
    "  For example: \n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  /git/dataptams2020 (paolo)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    " In any case to check on which local branch you are you can do \n",
    " \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  git branch -lvv\n",
    "  ```\n",
    " and you should see an asterisk next to the name of the branch on which you are working \n",

    "\n",
    "## How to submit your work and receive updates on labs and projects\n",
    "\n",
    " - **You will work almost exclusively on your branch**, so please make sure that you are on your branch. \n",
    " \n",
    " - When you want to push your results to the remote repository, to submit or modify your work, \n",
    "     after adding and committing the relevant files, do\n",
    "     \n",
    "```\n",
    "    \t  git push origin branch_name (use your actual branch name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " - You can update your branch, for example to view feedback given from the teachers by doing\n",
    "     (Always from your branch).\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \t  git pull origin branch_name (use your actual branch name)\n",

    "## Getting notebooks to run\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main tool to perform data analysis and present results is Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab.\n",
